Team 1 pulled from master, pushed and PR'd. No merge conflict. 
Team 2 did not pull master and added code on a different branch. 
Team 2 pushed and then did a PR, which gave a merge conflict. 
Team 1 reviewed and edited the code in github to resolve the conflict, commited the changes, and then confirmed the merge. 
Everyone pulled from master to get back on same page. 

We switched teams and repeated the process so everyone got to see the editing process in github to resolve the conflict.
